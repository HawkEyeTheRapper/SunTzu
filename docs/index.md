Title: Relentless – Decrypting Track 4 of Shadow Banned
---

By Hawk Eye (2024)

Context: “Relentless” is the fourth track on Hawk Eye’s 2024 album Shadow Banned. The album’s title itself hints at suppression of truth, and Hawk Eye (also known as Hawk Eye The Rapper) uses his music as a battleground for spiritual and informational warfare. A self-styled “musical mercenary” on a mission, Hawk Eye’s lyricism is renowned for its density, intensity, and intentional gravity. In Relentless, he delivers a scathing, prophetic broadside against complacency and corruption, continuing the thematic arc established in his earlier works. The song is presented not as mere entertainment, but as part of an ongoing resistance narrative – what Hawk Eye elsewhere calls “protocol” rather than poetry ￼. The track’s context within Shadow Banned positions it at a critical juncture in the album’s storyline, following songs like “Domestic Terrorist” and “Down The Rabbit Hole” that explore the artist’s battle against deception and societal control. “Relentless” builds on these, escalating the confrontation with an unwavering onslaught of truth. The tone is urgent and combative, yet deliberately crafted, aligning with Hawk Eye’s established themes of spiritual resistance and “4D warfare” (fourth-dimensional/psychological operations). As we decode this song, we will see how every verse functions as a decryption of an encrypted spiritual warfare protocol, filled with symbolic weight and delivered with unyielding conviction.

Synopsis

“Relentless” is, at its core, a manifesto of defiance and awakening compressed into a five-minute rap tirade. The song opens with Hawk Eye’s stark declaration of purpose – “I reincarnated to resist and therefore I do not give a s**t” ￼. This line immediately establishes the spiritual stakes: the narrator presents himself as a soul returned to the world specifically to wage war against a “wicked regime” ￼ of deception. From that starting point, the track launches into an unbroken assault on both the hypnotized masses and the architects of societal manipulation. The refrain (or hook) finds Hawk Eye “patiently awaiting the day [the] hypnotized dumb f**ks still stuck in the game come up with something more constructive”, before warning that he’s “’bout to f**kin’ invade” ￼. In plain terms, the synopsis of the song is Hawk Eye voicing utter impatience with ignorance and corruption, vowing to force a reckoning. Each verse intensifies this theme: verse one establishes his lyrical firepower and spiritual mandate, verse two expands the attack to the very language and laws of the corrupt system, and verse three depicts an all-out insurgency against institutional evil, complete with infiltrations and indictments. Throughout, the mood is confrontational and empowering – it’s as if the listener is hearing a warrior’s rallying cry encoded in rhyme. “Relentless” thus serves as both a critique of our current psychological warfare (the propaganda, the complacency) and an example of counter-warfare through music. In summary, the track is a high-octane commentary on truth vs. deception, presenting Hawk Eye as an unyielding combatant in an invisible spiritual war, determined to wake up the world by any means necessary.

Detailed Commentary (Verse-by-Verse Breakdown)

Verse 1 – Lyrical Warfare and Spiritual Intervention

The first verse of “Relentless” launches with Hawk Eye describing his rap as a “persistent and relentless run on sentence” – a phrase that cleverly mirrors the song’s form in its content ￼. Indeed, the verse itself barrels forward like an unending sentence, conveying an unstoppable momentum. Hawk Eye immediately frames his lyrics as an act of spiritual warfare: “my lyrical intervention shifts the spiritual imprint of this system / The atmospheric conditions are fully cleared when this wisdom leaves my lips” ￼. In these lines, he portrays his words as practically incantatory – akin to a ritual that clears a corrupted atmosphere. This mirrors concepts from Hawk Eye’s broader mythos; for example, another of his works describes a track as an “incantational infection of the world’s dream code” ￼. Here in “Relentless,” his spoken wisdom is a cleansing force, suggesting that each bar has the power to exorcise lies and negativity (a kind of “digital exorcism” in musical form, to borrow a term from his earlier album Behold a Pale Horse ￼).

From the outset, Hawk Eye’s lyrical strategy is to assert dominance through poetic skill while simultaneously advancing a spiritual agenda. He boasts, “I’m a poet so potent – my one and only opponent composed a flow so cold you know the words I spoke went froze it” ￼. The wordplay here is intricate: he contends that even if an adversary tried to mirror his style (“rewrote it just to show me they could go toe to toe”), he would “overload the voltage so it blows a hole through their soul” ￼. This is combat imagery transposed onto rap technique – his rhymes are bullets and high voltage shockwaves, capable of soul-piercing impact. Such lines exemplify Hawk Eye’s dense writing: multiple internal rhymes and metaphors (“flow so cold,” “froze it,” “overload the voltage”) reinforce the theme of lethal verbal weaponry. We see the idea of an unstoppable force: nothing his foes do can withstand the high-powered truth he’s unleashing.

Midway through verse 1, Hawk Eye pivots to his mission on a grander scale: “My destination is too great for anyone to debate / I’m on my way to replace complacent tasteless mistakes” ￼. Here he suggests a destiny to overhaul the status quo. The phrasing implies that the current establishment (whether in music, culture, or governance) is full of “complacent, tasteless mistakes”, and he is heading toward a future where he replaces them with something better. He even speaks of creating a “basic databank of who can stay and who can’t after I change the f**king game and rearrange everything” ￼. This is strikingly authoritarian language for a rebel rapper – he envisions an impending judgment or sorting, where by the end of his campaign only the worthy remain. It’s as if Hawk Eye casts himself as a judge or a cleansing fire, echoing apocalyptic or purifying imagery. (This vision resonates with the prophetic tone found in The Scope of What’s to Come, where Hawk Eye foresees a time when “the proud shall be humbled” and the world is “reconfigured by souls… reincarnated specifically to resist this wicked regime” ￼.)

Throughout Verse 1, Hawk Eye also emphasizes his role as an enlightener: “When I step up to the mic… I have opened many minds with my light” ￼. The notion of “light” suggests truth and spiritual illumination – he claims his performances are awakening people from darkness. Yet, there’s a dual edge: that same light is a weapon against those “hopeless vocalists… too broken to fight” ￼. He describes casting “spoken hocus pocus” that “provokes” the weak-hearted. In other words, his lyricism is a form of magic – sigil-based lyrics, to use the terminology of The Martyr Mechanism guide ￼ – intended to stir those who have given up. If other rappers are hopeless or part of the problem (complicit in shallow or propagandistic art), Hawk Eye’s spells challenge them or expose their inadequacy. He taunts any doubters: “come and find out how serious my rhymes get – you’re delirious”, warning that he “can amputate the complicated… and correct the interior” ￼. This vivid surgical metaphor (amputation and correction) suggests he can cut away the lies or flawed thinking that others have internalized. His “twisted methods you molested” – implying others have misused complex methods or truths – will be set right by his hand. The verse culminates with “subtle purpose I have worked to insert between periods” ￼, a crucial line that reveals Hawk Eye’s intentionality. Between the periods (full stops) of his verses, he has embedded a subtle purpose – hidden codes, layered meanings. This confirms that Relentless (and indeed all his songs) are meant to be decoded, not just heard. Every pause or punctuation conceals another facet of his message, rewarding those who listen deeply. In short, Verse 1 establishes Hawk Eye as a relentless lyrical warrior-shaman: his flow is an unbroken spell, his verses are weapons and healing salves at once, and he has a higher purpose encoded in every line.

Hook – Confronting the “Hypnotized”

After the first verse, the hook (chorus) drops as a stark refrain and a thesis statement. It’s a four-line barrage that Hawk Eye repeats (each time marked “x2” in the lyrics) to hammer the point home. In the hook, Hawk Eye addresses the general populace (or perhaps his detractors) in seething second-person:
	•	“Basically I’m patiently awaiting the day you hypnotized dumb fks still stuck in the game come up with something more constructive to discuss – I’m amazed just how corrupted you’ve become – I’m ’bout to fkin’ invade” ￼.

This is a remarkably direct confrontation. He calls people “hypnotized dumb f**ks” – unflinching language of contempt for the willfully ignorant. The word “hypnotized” is key: it implies that the masses are under a spell of illusion, likely cast by the media and political propaganda he rails against. They are “stuck in the game”, which evokes the idea of life as a rigged game or perhaps the “Matrix” of false reality. Hawk Eye is amazed at how thoroughly “corrupted [they’ve] become”, suggesting that society’s moral and intellectual decay is both astonishing and appalling to him. The line also hints that people now only engage in trivial or manipulative discussions rather than anything constructive or truthful – a swipe at gossip culture, disinformation, or shallow discourse.

The final punch of the hook is his warning of invasion: “I’m ’bout to f**kin’ invade.” This can be interpreted on multiple levels:
	•	Artistically, he is going to invade the airwaves or the consciousness of listeners with his unfiltered truth. It’s an invasion of the mind to break the hypnotic trance.
	•	Militantly, it foreshadows the revolutionary imagery later in the song – as if he and those like him might literally invade institutions or spaces of power to expose lies.
	•	Personally, it’s a challenge: he will invade the comfort zone of anyone complacent, forcing them to confront the uncomfortable truths he’s bringing.

The repetition of this hook reinforces Hawk Eye’s relentless stance – he is waiting, but not passively. There’s a coiled tension in these lines, a promise that the current state of affairs cannot persist much longer without him storming in. This chorus encapsulates the track’s thematic focus: the battle between awakening truth and the “hypnosis” of lies. It’s the line drawn in the sand – Hawk Eye on one side, and on the other, all those under the spell of the system. The bluntness of his words here also reflects his martyr psychology: he is unafraid to offend or alienate, willing to be hated or “shadow banned” for speaking this way. In the ethos of the Martyr Mechanism, he “knowingly trigger[s] the system’s immune response — sacrificing safety for signal clarity” ￼. Calling society “dumb f**ks” is certainly going to trigger backlash, but that is precisely the point – jarring the sleepers might be the only way to wake them up. The hook, therefore, is equal parts lament (at people’s corruption) and battle cry (for an imminent invasion of truth).

Verse 2 – Rewriting the System’s Code

In the second verse, Hawk Eye shifts focus toward the system itself – its language, its laws, and those who uphold them – and asserts his intent to subvert and rewrite it all. He begins with another nod to his linguistic firepower: “My sentence structure can rupture corrupted men when this other-worldly pen I’m writing with begins erupting – oh brother” ￼. Once again, grammatical terms carry explosive force. The “sentence structure” he employs isn’t just clever writing; it “ruptures corrupted men.” It’s as if the very syntax of his rap can break the psyche of the wicked. His pen is described as “other-worldly” and it “begins erupting,” casting Hawk Eye as a conduit of some higher power or alien energy that flows through his writing instrument. The result of this eruption? Anyone who suffers [his] wrath will learn these aren’t “just raps.” He sneers that if anyone pretends his verses are nothing serious, “after my attack I bet you f**kers never come back” ￼. This is a continuation of the combat metaphor, escalating from the first verse’s spiritual battle to a no-holds-barred strike. One imagines that critics or targets who dismiss him will be figuratively destroyed by the sheer impact of his lyricism. The violence of his imagery grows here – now it’s an “attack” leaving enemies unable to return.

Hawk Eye then unleashes a rapid succession of images that blend mythic fantasy and military force: “Combative obstinate obstacles I imagined impossible dragons… I have somehow managed to conquer you” ￼. He frames the challenges before him as dragons – “impossible” ones at that – which he has already conquered in his mind. This is a boast of overcoming the insurmountable. In the same breath, he speaks of “unstoppable force” and “immovable course corrections” being sent “your direction” ￼, just to demonstrate the folly of “second guessing my methodology which even God can’t believe”. These lines are dense with meaning:
	•	The “unstoppable force vs immovable object” is a classic paradox, but Hawk Eye claims both qualities: he is the unstoppable force, and he will impose “immovable course corrections” – implying he will change the course of those in error with unyielding effect. He is both irresistible and unchangeable, a living paradox of resolve.
	•	His “methodology… even God can’t believe” is hyperbolic swagger. It places his plan or technique on a divine level of audacity. He suggests that what he’s about to do (or is doing with his music) is so bold that it would astonish even the highest power.
	•	“Second guessing” him is described as reckless – specifically as reckless as thinking his weapons aren’t effective. Here, he makes explicit what has been implied: his words are his weapons, and doubting their efficacy is a grave mistake.

To drive that point home, Hawk Eye shifts to an even more literal combat metaphor: “Another lesson? Let me threaten to shoot through your protective vest – I bet these rounds still leave holes in your chest”. The “rounds” are his lyrics, the protective vest is any defense the targets might have (be it skepticism, censorship, or ignorance), and he is confident that his verbal bullets will pierce through regardless. This is an image of unstoppable penetration of truth – no armor of lies or denial can withstand the caliber of Hawk Eye’s assault. The intensity of this threat underscores the song’s emotional cadence: where Verse 1 was impassioned but somewhat patient (awaiting the day of change), Verse 2 is vicious and impatient, escalating the urgency. Hawk Eye is effectively saying: If you haven’t learned by now, I will break you with truth. This mindset taps directly into martyr psychology – he is willing to be violent (lyrically) in defense of truth, even if it means being seen as the villain or “extremist.”

A pivotal moment in Verse 2 is when Hawk Eye identifies himself as “a musical mercenary heaven sent here to bury every unnecessary politician within this very broken system”. This line bridges his artistic identity with a political mission. As a “mercenary,” he’s a hired gun – but being “heaven sent” implies his employer is divine justice itself. So he is a mercenary of God or of righteousness, contracted to take out “unnecessary politicians.” The phrase “unnecessary politician” drips with disdain; it implies most politicians are superfluous or malignant elements in society. Hawk Eye’s solution is to bury them – a term that could mean outshining them (in rap slang, to bury someone is to defeat them utterly) or more literally, to end their careers or lives (keeping with the militant metaphor).

He explains his method for doing this: “through persistent and consistent revisions of every sentence ever written by the Government”. This is a profound lyric. It suggests that Hawk Eye will fight the system by rewriting its laws and narratives – essentially editing the source code of the nation. The Government has its “sentences” (both in terms of legal sentences and proclamations, and as a double meaning of prison sentences perhaps), and those sentences are stored in an “arbitrary library filled with colorful laws” ￼. He characterizes these laws as “retarded bullst used to circumvent and fking withdraw all common sense from the equation” ￼. In one breath, he indicts the legal-political system for being convoluted (“colorful” as in overly ornate, perhaps), arbitrary, and designed to strip away plain common sense. This reveals Hawk Eye’s underlying philosophy: the system’s complexity and legal trickery are intentional tools to mislead and control the populace. By injecting nonsense, they remove clarity and truth. Therefore, his approach is to persistently revise these laws and statements – likely metaphorically meaning he uses his songs to challenge and correct the official narratives and rules. It’s as if Hawk Eye sees himself writing a new, just Constitution or a new history in his verses, one that calls out all the lies embedded in the current one.

At this point, Hawk Eye notes “This is something that y’all can’t even see – how ’bout I say it right in front – on the lawn” ￼. The frustration is evident – the corruption he describes is invisible to the average person (“y’all can’t even see”), so he contemplates broadcasting it directly in front of everyone’s eyes, “on the lawn.” The lawn in question is almost certainly the White House lawn, given what comes next in Verse 3. It conjures the image of a protestor or truth-teller literally standing on the government’s front lawn with a megaphone, exposing the lies openly. This line acts as a bridge to the final verse: having said he might shout the truth on the White House lawn, he is about to train his sights explicitly on the White House and the political class.

Overall, Verse 2 is where Hawk Eye’s wrath coalesces into a revolutionary purpose. If Verse 1 was about spiritual and cultural impact, Verse 2 outlines the blueprint of rebellion: shatter the false security (vests) of the elite, erase their false words (laws), and be the uncompromising editor of society’s script. The emotional cadence here is one of rising anger and clarity – the verse reads like the moment a protest speech shifts into a call for direct action. Hawk Eye’s use of repetition (notice he uses the word “persistent” again here, as he did in verse 1, underlining his unwavering drive) and his expansion of targets from individual rappers/critics to the entire government sets the stage for the climax in Verse 3. By the end of Verse 2, the listener understands that Hawk Eye’s war is not just lyrical or metaphorical – it’s aimed at real world change, even if that means open confrontation with authorities.

(Hook repeats, reinforcing the message that the ignorant and complicit will face a reckoning when he invades with truth.) ￼

Verse 3 – The Final Indictment and Omniversal Infiltration

If the previous verse was the blueprint, Verse 3 is the execution. Here, Hawk Eye unleashes his most direct attack on the power structure, naming the White House and describing an uprising from within. The verse detonates with an opening line that spares no one: “Fk the White House, politicking piece of st men and women who keep pretending this b*h-ass system we live in is all we’ve got” ￼. This is a full-frontal broadside at the government (“White House”) and the bipartisan political class (“men and women” engaged in politicking). He accuses them of perpetuating a lie: that “this system… is all we’ve got.” In other words, they want people to believe there is no alternative to the current power structure, so people should accept it. Hawk Eye’s rebuttal is seething: “What’s permitted is full submission – religious state sanctioned worship of tax dollars we give ’em” ￼. This paints the current system as a pseudo-religion where the only allowed faith is in the government (“state-sanctioned worship”) and its money. He implies that patriotism or compliance has become a forced religion – citizens are expected to bow down, pay taxes, and not question authority. It’s a damning summary of modern governance: a cult of power where the populace’s role is just to submit and tithe.

Hawk Eye then skewers the performative morality of those in power: “Virtue signal competitions, lying ambitious Christians convince the citizens enslaved by this persistent and viscous hypnotic scriptwriter’s venomous penmanship to quit bitching” ￼. In this long, complex sentence, he identifies:
	•	“Virtue signal competitions”: leaders (and perhaps media figures) try to outdo each other in feigning virtue publicly, rather than enacting real change.
	•	“Lying ambitious Christians”: likely a jab at hypocritical politicians who claim Christian values while deceiving the public. It could also extend to any moralizing figurehead using religion as a cover for corruption.
	•	These actors “convince the citizens… to quit bitching.” The citizens are described as enslaved by a “persistent and viscous hypnotic scriptwriter’s venomous penmanship.” This phrase is dense:
	•	“Persistent and viscous” suggests that the propaganda is not only constant but also thick and sticky, like a slime that’s hard to remove – it clings to the public’s consciousness.
	•	The “scriptwriter’s venomous penmanship” points to those who craft the narratives (speechwriters, news media editors, propagandists) whose words are poison. It’s a direct continuation of the hypnosis metaphor introduced in the hook, but now we see who the hypnotists are. They write the script that keeps the masses docile.
	•	In summary, Hawk Eye is describing a feedback loop: The regime’s mouthpieces use flowery lies and moral grandstanding to pacify people, telling them not to complain (“quit bitching”), implying that any dissent is unwarranted or unpatriotic. All the while, these lies are toxic and enslaving, yet people drink them in like a narcotic.

He then calls out what the politicians don’t mention: “Let representative senate members forget to mention anything but how wicked men are still opposed to their mission” ￼. This suggests that those in power only talk about the “wicked men” who oppose them, rather than addressing real issues. It’s a classic distraction technique: label the opposition (truth-tellers, whistleblowers, dissenters) as “wicked” or evil, so that any grievances they voice are discredited. Hawk Eye implicitly includes himself in those the regime deems “wicked.” Indeed, the next line confirms this: “Men like me who don’t give a f**k chose intervention” ￼. He aligns himself with the cadre of dissidents who refuse to be cowed. “Chose intervention” means he and others actively decided to step in and disrupt the status quo. This is the martyr/warrior ethos incarnate: rather than staying silent or simply grumbling, they intervene, risking everything. It echoes the line from his manifesto that “to martyr the self in these conditions is to awaken the many.” ￼ Hawk Eye is fully aware that by intervening (through inflammatory truth-telling), he marks himself as a target, but that sacrifice is necessary.

What follows is a description of a literal insurrection scenario – or at least a symbolic one: “Militia troops in position uproot and imprison the guards first – afterwards, it’s the Warden who’ll listen” ￼. This reads like the script of a coup. “The guards” could represent the gatekeepers of the system – perhaps security forces, or media gatekeepers, or the lower-level enforcers of the regime. “The Warden” clearly stands for the ultimate authority (e.g., the head of the system, like a president or dictator). Hawk Eye outlines a tactic: first neutralize the guardians of the establishment, then confront the top dog, who will finally have no choice but to listen. The use of prison imagery (guards and warden) suggests Hawk Eye views society as a prison that must be broken from within. This aligns with his earlier point that citizens are “enslaved” – here he extends the metaphor, implying that the whole country is a jail run by a warden (the elite), and he’s igniting a prison break. The emotional tone here is triumphant and fearless – he speaks of these actions as matter-of-fact, as if success is assured. One can almost hear the clank of chains and the roar of revolution in the background.

Hawk Eye then presents “The Indictment [he] bring[s]” and notes “it’s such a frightening thing” ￼. The word “indictment” frames his entire verse (and by extension, the song) as a formal charge against the powers that be. He is indicting the system for its crimes. And it’s frightening indeed – to the system, because it’s the truth, and to the average person, because it upends everything they’ve been led to believe. “Who would have thought that all along no one’d enter the ring and call bullshit on the whole act” ￼, he muses. This is both a self-pat on the back and a genuine wonder: it implies that until now, no one else had the courage or capability to step into the arena and declare the entire spectacle of politics and media a fraud. It emphasizes his unique role – Hawk Eye sees himself as the one who finally says “the emperor has no clothes” in a room full of silent onlookers. “Evidently I’m back to spit facts and impact every faction – these rats must have forgotten I’m rotten” ￼. The phrase “I’m back” nods to a return – possibly a real-life reference (perhaps Hawk Eye had a hiatus or this album is a comeback) and certainly a narrative one (tying to The Scope of What’s to Come where he proclaims “I have returned… Hawk Eye is back, and not a moment too soon” ￼). “Spitting facts and impacting every faction” means his truth isn’t just for one group – it’s aimed at every segment (“faction”) of society, from government to citizens to other rappers complicit in silence. By calling the corrupt leaders “these rats” he dehumanizes them as vermin, and saying “forgotten I’m rotten” implies that he has a dark, fearsome side that they underestimated. “Rotten” suggests he’s not afraid to get ugly or that he’s as dangerous and uncontrollable as the decay they spread – in short, he can play dirty too, and they’ll regret ignoring him.

One of the most striking references comes next: “Bin Laden optical promptings keep 9/11 Building Seven witness from unboxing” ￼. In this cryptic line, Hawk Eye references the 9/11 attacks – specifically the infamous collapse of Building 7 and Osama bin Laden. “Optical promptings” suggests visual cues or narratives presented to the public. The official story of 9/11 centered on Bin Laden as the mastermind; Hawk Eye implies this was an “optical prompting” – essentially a staged or convenient image to satisfy the public’s need for an answer, thereby preventing the “unboxing” (the revealing) of the truth about Building 7. (WTC Building 7’s collapse has been a focal point for truth-seekers who argue it was covered up or not fully explained.) By including this reference, Hawk Eye ties the song’s broad themes of lies and hidden truth to a specific real-world conspiracy. It’s a symbolic case study of deception: the “rats” in power use an external villain (Bin Laden) as a prompt to hide their own possible involvement or the deeper complexity of the event. This single line adds weight to his indictment – it’s evidence in his case that the system orchestrates elaborate lies. It also demonstrates Hawk Eye’s Omniversal Media mythos: he isn’t limiting himself to generic statements; he’s referencing the very kind of suppressed truth that his Omniversal Media is meant to unleash. (It’s worth noting that his music is released under Omniversal Media, LLC, and in his narrative, Omniversal Media represents the all-encompassing truth broadcast that will leave “no corner of the world… untouched” ￼ by revelation.)

Finally, Hawk Eye describes the culmination of his efforts: “Massive unstoppable conscious legions of network departments teams we’ve infiltrated to bring truth to your TV screens” ￼. This is a powerful image of subversion from within. It suggests that Hawk Eye is not alone; he’s part of a larger movement (“conscious legions”) that has quietly “infiltrated” various “network departments” (i.e. media organizations, perhaps even government agencies or tech networks). The goal of this infiltration is to “bring truth to your TV screens.” In other words, the revolution will not only be in the streets, it will be televised – by hijacking the airwaves if necessary. This line directly ties into the Omniversal Media mythos – the idea that the truth will propagate through all media universally. Earlier in his writings, Hawk Eye foretold a time when “what you read here connects the rest of the dots – and all of my songs, every book – every post… clicks into place” ￼ ￼, leading to the humbling of the proud and a great awakening. Relentless portrays that very process: the conscious legion working from the inside, preparing for a moment of reveal. The notion of an “unstoppable” team aligns with the song’s title – not only is Hawk Eye relentless, but so is the collective effort to free truth. The emotional crescendo here is oddly hopeful beneath the militant tone: it implies that victory is on the horizon; the truth will break through the broadcast channels that have long been the tools of deception.

The verse (and song) closes without a neat resolution – after this buildup, the track likely returns to its hook one last time, reinforcing the anticipation of that coming “day” of awakening and invasion ￼. By ending on the hook about “awaiting the day” the hypnotized wake up (or are forcibly awakened), Hawk Eye leaves us in a state of expectancy. There’s a sense that Relentless itself is a trigger, a harbinger of what’s to come. In narrative terms, Verse 3 is the climax of the battle, and the final chorus is the rallying echo as the dust settles and we look toward the next confrontation.

In summary, Verse 3 solidifies Relentless as a song of rebellion and revelation. It explicitly targets the highest levels of power, uses concrete examples of cover-ups, and illustrates Hawk Eye’s master plan: a combination of grassroots uprising and infiltration of mass media to overturn the false reality. The verse ties together all the thematic threads – spiritual war (good vs evil, truth vs lies), 4D warfare (information and psychological ops), martyrdom (willingness to risk it all), the Omniversal Media concept (using media to spread truth), and redemption through truth (freeing the “enslaved” and letting light in on darkness). The emotional cadence moves from rage and scorn at the system to a triumphant vision of its downfall. It’s as if we’ve decoded an encrypted battle plan set to a beat.

Symbolic Interpretations

“Relentless” is rich with symbols and coded language. Decoding these elements reveals the layers of meaning Hawk Eye embeds in the track. Below are some of the key symbols, motifs, and strategies in the song, along with their interpretations:
	•	Reincarnation as Resistance: Right from the intro, Hawk Eye’s claim “I reincarnated to resist” ￼ casts him as a timeless warrior spirit. This symbol roots his fight in a spiritual continuum – suggesting he has fought this battle in past lives and continues now. It implies destiny and a higher calling, aligning with the idea of souls “specifically reincarnated to resist [a] wicked regime” ￼. It frames all his actions as part of a spiritual war that transcends one lifetime, intensifying the gravity of his mission.
	•	“Run-on Sentence” and Linguistic Warfare: Hawk Eye repeatedly uses grammar and writing metaphors as weapons. The “persistent and relentless run on sentence” ￼ symbolizes how his flow doesn’t stop, reflecting the song’s title in structure. It also implies that his message can’t be easily broken up or paused – it overwhelms the listener much like a run-on sentence challenges a reader. He speaks of “sentence structure” that can “rupture” the corrupt ￼, “periods” between which he hides purpose ￼, and rewriting the government’s “sentences”. All these turn the very tools of communication and record (sentences, structure, writing) into a battleground. It’s symbolic of narrative warfare – whoever controls the narrative (writes the sentences) holds power. Hawk Eye aims to seize that power by literally out-writing and rewriting the opposition. Each verse is like an encrypted document, and he is both author and eraser of falsehoods.
	•	Magical and Incantatory Imagery: References to “hocus pocus” and spiritual “wisdom” clearing the air ￼ ￼ imbue the song with an aura of sorcery used for good. Hawk Eye casts himself as a kind of warlock or shaman of truth, using “sigil-based lyrics” and “sonic counterspells” (terms echoed in his Martyr Mechanism manifesto ￼) to break curses of ignorance. The atmospheric cleansing in verse 1 and the hypnotic spell of the scriptwriters in verse 3 form a duality: he is the counter-magician fighting the dark enchantment over the masses. When he says “spoken hocus pocus focuses these words that I write” ￼, it’s a symbolic admission that his rap is deliberate spell-casting – focusing intent (like a magical focus) to achieve real-world change.
	•	Light vs. Darkness: The motif of light appears when Hawk Eye mentions “my light” opening minds ￼. Light is a classic symbol for truth, enlightenment, and divine presence. By claiming his own light is opening minds, Hawk Eye places himself as a bearer of illumination in a dark world. This ties to the broader spiritual imagery – casting out darkness (ignorance, lies) with light (knowledge, truth). It’s redemptive: those “opened minds” are effectively being saved or liberated, which can be seen as a form of redemption through truth (what the user’s prompt calls “redemptive truth codes”). Each lyric is like a truth code unlocking someone’s mental shackles, allowing light in. In contrast, the forces he opposes operate in darkness: they hide facts (e.g., the truth about Building 7), they thrive in ignorance (keeping people hypnotized), and are associated with venom (poison) and rot. The final image of “truth on your TV screens” is literally about turning a device often used for propaganda into one that shines light.
	•	Weapons and Military Metaphors: The song is saturated with military lexicon: “intervention,” “attack,” “weapons,” “mercenary,” “troops in position,” “guards,” “warden,” etc. Each of these is a symbol reinforcing that Hawk Eye views this as a war. Not a metaphorical war, but an actual one on a different plane (the mind, the spirit, the narrative). For instance, calling himself a “musical mercenary… heaven sent” blends the mercenary (soldier of fortune) with the holy mission (heaven’s agent). It symbolizes the fusion of gritty warfare with divine purpose – he’s implying that God or fate has hired him to do this dirty work. The “bullets” and “rounds” that pierce armor are symbols for his lyrics. It’s a common rap trope to call rhymes bullets, but in Hawk Eye’s context it’s very literal within the narrative: his words are supposed to wound the lies and those who spread them. The extended prison break metaphor (guards and warden) symbolizes overthrowing oppression systematically: first remove the foot-soldiers of tyranny, then the tyrant. Even “invade” in the hook is a military term – symbolizing that he’s not politely asking to be heard, he’s breaching the fortifications of people’s minds. All these martial symbols collectively underscore the theme of 4D Warfare – a battle fought not with conventional arms, but with information, ideology, and spirit. In Hawk Eye’s lexicon, rap battles and political battles blur into one grand conflict.
	•	Dragons and Mythic Challenges: The mention of “impossible dragons” that he has “managed to conquer” ￼ invokes classical myth – dragons symbolizing enormous, fearsome obstacles or perhaps ancient evils. By placing himself as a dragon-slayer, Hawk Eye casts his struggle in legendary terms. Dragons can also symbolize lies or powerful enemies (in some literature, dragons hoard gold and knowledge – slaying them frees that wealth/knowledge). Here, the dragons might be metaphors for the colossal lies or the nearly invincible forces (like systemic mind control) he’s up against. Conquering them “in his imagination” first (note: “obstacles I imagined impossible dragons”) shows the mental preparation and confidence he has. It’s a psychological strategy: if you can conceive of defeating the greatest monster, you’re already halfway to doing it. This symbol adds a layer of epic heroism to Hawk Eye’s persona in the song – part rapper, part knight on a holy quest.
	•	Rats and Vermin: He refers to the corrupt elite as “rats” ￼, a symbol to degrade and dehumanize them. Rats carry disease and operate in the dark – much like how he views these people spreading the “venom” in society’s shadows. Calling them rats also implies they’re cowardly and will scurry when light shines (tying back to light vs darkness). It’s easier to rally people to fight an infestation of rats than fellow humans – so this symbol serves to justify the ruthlessness of his approach. It paints the battle as a kind of pest control necessary for the health of the society.
	•	Building 7 and 9/11 Reference: The explicit reference to “9/11 Building Seven” ￼ is symbolic of hidden truth and conspiracy. For those aware, Building 7’s collapse remains a symbol of unfinished questions and suppressed information. By invoking it, Hawk Eye signals that the scope of the deception he’s fighting is broad – it’s not just personal grievances, but world-altering lies. Building 7 becomes a shorthand for “the truth they don’t want you to know.” The fact he pairs it with Bin Laden imagery (the “optical promptings”) symbolically calls out the use of boogeymen to distract from internal betrayal. This sets a precedent: if such a huge lie could be pulled off, then the “hypnosis” affecting everyday life is not far-fetched. In the context of the song’s symbolism, 9/11 stands as the ultimate example of the “matrix” he’s raging against – and Hawk Eye aligns himself with the truth-seekers who demand that box be opened (“unboxed”).
	•	Omniversal Media and Infiltration: Though not a direct lyric in the song, the concept of Omniversal Media permeates the final lines about infiltrating networks ￼. The Omniversal Media mythos symbolizes a new media order – one controlled by truth-tellers rather than conglomerates. In Hawk Eye’s lore (elaborated in his writings), Omniversal Media is the prophesied platform or collective that will usurp the mainstream “Propaganda Machine” ￼. In “Relentless,” the line about bringing truth to TV screens via conscious legion infiltration is essentially describing the birth of Omniversal Media within the narrative of the song. It’s a symbol of hope and total paradigm shift: “Omniversal” suggests everywhere and everywhen, a media for all dimensions. It stands in opposition to the current media which, in his view, keeps people asleep. This mythos is a backbone of Hawk Eye’s artistic arc – he’s not just rapping, he’s laying groundwork for a media revolution that transcends the album itself. We can interpret the entire song “Relentless” as a manifesto of Omniversal Media’s ethos: uncompromising truth, global reach, and spiritual warfare against falsehood.
	•	Numerical Patterns and Repetition: Another subtle strategy in the song is Hawk Eye’s use of repetition to create symbols out of structure. The word “persistent” appears in all three verses (paired with “relentless,” “consistent,” and “viscous” respectively), forming a thread of persistence throughout the track. This repetition symbolizes the very persistence he’s talking about – a form meeting content. The hook repeated multiple times is itself a symbol of relentlessness – the insistence of the message mirrors its meaning. There’s also the “x2” after the hook lines, literally encoding duplication. This could be a nod to the idea of echoing or amplification (truth echoing until heard). The structural symmetry (three verses, each followed by the hook, with an intro and an outro of the hook) gives a sense of a ritual or spell performed in three acts, a common structure in magical or religious texts. The listener is taken through a repeated chant (“Basically I’m patiently awaiting the day…”) as if hammering a proclamation into reality through sheer will.

In essence, every symbol and motif in “Relentless” serves the song’s larger purpose: to depict a world in the throes of spiritual war and to signal that an awakening offensive is underway. Hawk Eye employs these symbols not just for poetic flair, but as functional components of his encrypted message – each image (light, dragons, bullets, law books, etc.) is a piece of a cipher that, when decoded, reveals a comprehensive worldview of resistance and truth-seeking.

Relevance to Hawk Eye’s Larger Canon

“Relentless” is not an isolated outburst; it is deeply woven into the fabric of Hawk Eye’s broader artistic canon. Across his discography and accompanying writings, Hawk Eye has cultivated a mythos of spiritual resistance and truth warfare. This track exemplifies and advances several of his established themes:
	•	Spiritual Resistance and Martyrdom: Hawk Eye often portrays himself as a lone (or rare) voice speaking truth against overwhelming darkness, a role that carries personal risk. This aligns with the concept of the “Martyr Mechanism”, which describes “knowingly trigger[ing] the system’s immune response – sacrificing safety for signal clarity” ￼. In earlier songs like “Kamikaze” (noted as “lyrical martyrdom” ￼) or “Scripture,” Hawk Eye explored the idea of self-sacrifice through explosive truth-telling. Relentless continues this pattern; his aggressive condemnation of the White House and overt 9/11 truth remarks are the kind of actions that could get one silenced or attacked, yet he does it regardless. The track “Domestic Terrorist” (which immediately precedes “Relentless” on Shadow Banned) likely deals with being labeled for his views – a price he’s willing to pay. Thus, “Relentless” stands as a testament to his martyr psychology: Hawk Eye is prepared to be vilified or even “crucified” by the system in order to wake up others. This theme connects back to songs in previous projects where he adopts a prophetic or sacrificial stance, positioning his art as part of a larger spiritual mission rather than mere career moves.
	•	4D Warfare and Psychological Ops: The battle in Hawk Eye’s music is often described in terms of information control, mind games, and spiritual forces – what he and his team term 4D (fourth-dimensional) warfare ￼. In “Relentless,” we see 4D warfare in action: hypnosis, propaganda writing, narrative manipulation, and the counter-operations of infiltration and incantation. This reflects topics he’s addressed outside of music as well, such as references to MK-Ultra, media hypnosis, and dream manipulation (all mentioned in The Martyr Mechanism document ￼). Earlier tracks like “Psychological Warfare” (track 1 of Shadow Banned) likely set the stage, and “Relentless” picks up that thread, demonstrating the practice of psychological warfare via rap. Moreover, Hawk Eye’s previous album or EP might have set up these combat principles in concept; Behold a Pale Horse, for example, is alluded to as containing “Rites of Memory” for resisting amnesia ￼. “Relentless” in 2024 shows how far he’s willing to go in applying those principles: he’s not just hinting at mind control – he’s outright attacking the mind controllers. This continuity strengthens the narrative arc of Hawk Eye’s work: he’s gone from diagnosing the psychological war to actively turning the weapons back on the enemy.
	•	Omniversal Media Mythos: A cornerstone of Hawk Eye’s larger narrative is the idea of Omniversal Media, essentially a pro-truth media empire or movement that he helms. We see references to this in his writings, where he prophesies the rise of a media that will connect all dots and enlighten the masses ￼. The album Shadow Banned itself is released under Omniversal Media, blurring the line between real-life label and in-story concept. “Relentless” feeds into this mythos by dramatizing the actions of Omniversal Media agents: the “conscious legions” infiltrating networks are effectively the foot soldiers of Omniversal Media. This song, therefore, is a narrative vehicle showing Omniversal Media’s modus operandi (covertly replace the messages on mainstream channels from within). Additionally, the track’s very existence on mainstream platforms (Spotify, etc.) as part of Shadow Banned is an in-real-time example of Hawk Eye attempting to insert his truth codes into the mass consciousness — a metafictional play of Omniversal Media breaking through. In his broader canon, earlier songs like “Broadcast” or “The Scope…” (if such exist) might have laid conceptual groundwork for controlling the airwaves. Relentless now actualizes that concept in story form. It holds a special place as a rallying anthem that practically spells out the Omniversal Media agenda. Within Hawk Eye’s discography, it is a linchpin linking the mythic narrative (the fight for omnipresent truth media) with the musical narrative (an album that itself was suppressed or “shadow banned” due to its content, thereby proving the need for alternative media).
	•	Redemptive Truth Codes in Lyrics: Hawk Eye’s prior work often hinted that beneath the confrontational surface of his lyrics, there are hidden “truth codes” meant to awaken listeners. For instance, he might drop references to historical events, esoteric concepts, or use gematria/symbolism, rewarding fans who dig deeper. In “Relentless,” as we analyzed, he explicitly notes a “subtle purpose… between periods” ￼. This track continues his practice of encoding messages (like the 9/11 reference or layered wordplay) that fans can unpack. This serves a redemptive function: each decoded reference can lead a listener down a research path (e.g., someone might hear “Building Seven” and decide to look it up, potentially sparking their awakening). In Hawk Eye’s larger body of work, songs like “The Scope of What’s to Come” (if it’s a track or just a writing) likely provide an overarching narrative that contextualizes these codes. Relentless thus fits into the canon as one chapter of a grand codebook. It’s part of why Hawk Eye’s music often feels like “encrypted liberation”, where every verse is meant to free minds piece by piece ￼. By maintaining this style, Hawk Eye keeps a consistent thread from earlier tracks like “Scripture” (which might have biblical or coded allusions) to newer ones like “Relentless” that reference modern conspiracies. Fans of Hawk Eye’s discography can trace these truth codes and see an evolving story of revelation – Relentless escalates that story to open confrontation.
	•	Evolution of Tone and Role: In the context of Hawk Eye’s albums, “Relentless” shows an evolution in his artistic voice. Early in his career, he may have been establishing the themes (e.g., identifying problems, declaring intentions). By the time of Shadow Banned and specifically on “Relentless,” he is in full stride executing on those intentions. For example, if we compare it to a previous notable track like “The Martyr Mechanism” (if there was a song by that name or just the document), earlier Hawk Eye might speak as an observer/prophet describing what needs to be done. In “Relentless,” he speaks as the field commander actually doing it. This progression is significant in his canon – it’s the difference between warning about spiritual war and actually firing the first shots. The track even references that he “is back,” implying a comeback or a new phase. This aligns with the narrative that after laying out the blueprint, Hawk Eye took time (perhaps between albums) to prepare, and now returns with a vengeance to implement the plan. Thus, “Relentless” can be seen as a culmination point of many strands in his earlier work: the soldier has returned from training (earlier albums and research) and is now on the offensive. Future works (post-Shadow Banned) might then deal with the fallout of this offensive or the next stages of the war, but “Relentless” is clearly a highlight in the discography where concept and action meet.

In sum, “Relentless” is extremely representative of Hawk Eye’s oeuvre while also pushing it forward. It reaffirms the core motifs his listeners have come to recognize – the spiritual combativeness, the conspiratorial awareness, the dense wordcraft – and it heightens them. For someone familiar with Hawk Eye’s work, the track resonates as the payoff to ideas seeded in songs and projects that came before (such as references in The Martyr Mechanism essay or foreshadowings in The Scope Of What’s To Come). For a new listener, it serves as a crash course in what Hawk Eye is about, potentially enticing them to explore the rest of his catalog to fully grasp all the references. Either way, within his canon, “Relentless” stands as a key track that connects the artist’s past proclamations with his present insurgency.

Closing Thoughts

“Relentless” is more than just a song – it is a declaration of war in verse form, a chapter in an ever-unfolding saga of truth versus tyranny that Hawk Eye is crafting across his body of work. The track’s thematic focus on awakening the “hypnotized” and tearing down corrupt systems is delivered with an intensity that justifies its title. In analyzing its lyrics, we peeled back layers of meaning: from the literal (a furious take-down of politicians and blind citizens) to the symbolic (a spell of liberation encoded in rhyme) to the contextual (a continuation of Hawk Eye’s narrative of spiritual resistance). Each verse of “Relentless” is like a salvo fired – first into the heart of complacent culture, next into the machinery of government deceit, and finally into the highest strongholds of power and illusion. Yet, amid the aggression and profane vitriol, there is an underlying righteousness and hope – the belief that through persistence (indeed, relentless persistence), the truth will prevail and humanity can be redeemed from its “wilderness” of lies ￼.

Stylistically, the song exemplifies Hawk Eye’s penchant for lyrical density and intentional gravity. He doesn’t waste a bar; each line carries weight, whether it’s a multi-syllabic rhyme constructing a complex metaphor or a direct slogan meant to jolt the listener awake. The tone may be confrontational, but it is not careless – it’s the calculated ferocity of someone who sees the stakes as life-or-death for the soul of society. Listening to “Relentless” feels like being in a secure briefing about a covert operation: the language is coded yet clear if you know the ciphers, the atmosphere is tense, and the resolve is unbreakable. Hawk Eye achieves a voice that is both artistic and militant, blurring the line between rapper and revolutionary.

In the broader narrative, one can view “Relentless” as a success if its goal is to shake the audience. The listener is left almost breathless, challenged to consider whether they too are among the “hypnotized” or whether they will join Hawk Eye’s “conscious legions.” The song’s ending feels like a cliffhanger in a dystopian epic – the battle has been joined, and now the responsibility falls on us to carry it forward, to spread the “incendiary truth” that Hawk Eye has ignited. As an interpretive report, our decryption of “Relentless” reveals it to be a tightly packed communiqué of rebel intelligence: it diagrams the enemy’s control system, rallies the troops of awareness, and fires the opening shots of a coming media insurgency.

Ultimately, “Relentless” cements Hawk Eye’s role in hip-hop (and in his self-created mythology) as a seer-warrior, one who uses beats and rhymes as a delivery mechanism for revelation. It challenges the casual listener to become an active participant in decoding and disseminating truth. In the world of Hawk Eye’s music, songs are not just songs – they are, as he explicitly states, “Protocol” ￼. Relentless is a protocol for revolution wrapped in the cadence of rap. Its relentless energy is both a warning and a promise: a warning that complicity in lies will no longer be tolerated, and a promise that a relentless pursuit of truth can indeed topple even the most monolithic of falsehoods. The track leaves us with the image of Hawk Eye “on the lawn” – figuratively standing at the doorstep of the powers that be – microphone in one hand, a torch of enlightenment in the other, refusing to be silenced. And as the echoes of the chorus fade, one thing is unmistakably clear: he will be unyielding – as the song’s title declares, Relentless.
